 Project Title:-
Path Finder in a Maze using Python

Description:-
This project visualizes the shortest path-finding algorithm using a maze layout. It uses Python's curses library to animate the search process in the terminal.

Technologies Used:-
Python 3.13
curses library
Queue (BFS Algorithm)

Features:-
Dynamic terminal animation of the path-finding process
Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Start point (O) and end point (X) in a hardcoded maze
